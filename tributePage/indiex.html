                <ul class="tribute-ul">
                    <li><strong>Jan 23, 1897</strong> &dash; Born in Cuttack, Orissa, India</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 1, 1916</strong> &dash; Expelled from Presidency College in Calcutta for
                        nationalistic activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 1, 1919</strong> &dash; He graduated from Scottish Churches College.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 1, 1920</strong> &dash; He passed the civil service exam after studying at the
                        University of Cambridge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apr 1, 1921</strong> &dash; Resigned from the Indian Civil Service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dec 1, 1921</strong> &dash; Sent to jail by the British due to his activities with the
                        Bengal Congress Volunteers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 1, 1927</strong> &dash; Upon being released from prison he found the Bengal Congress
                        in disarray.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 1, 1936</strong> &dash; Returned from Europe &mdash; Upon arriving he was taken into
                        custody and released a year later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 1, 1938</strong> &dash; Elected president of the Indian National Congress and formed
                        a national planning committee, which formulated a policy of broad industrialization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 1, 1939</strong> &dash; Resigned from Presidency &mdash; He felt like he needed to
                        resign because of a lack of support from Gandhi.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jul 1, 1940</strong> &dash; Incarcerated Yet Again &mdash; Was Incarcerated due to his
                        creation of the Foward Bloc. His refusal to remain in prison at this critical period of India’s
                        history was expressed in a determination to fast to death, which frightened the British
                        government into releasing him.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 26, 1941</strong> &dash;Escaped from Prison &mdash;
                        though closely watched, he escaped from his Calcutta residence in disguise and, traveling via
                        Kabul and Moscow, eventually reached Germany in April.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan 24, 1942</strong> &dash; He and other Indians who had gathered in Berlin made
                        regular broadcasts from the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio beginning in January 1942, speaking
                        in English, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and Pashto.</li>
                    <li><strong>May 1, 1943</strong> &dash; A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of
                        Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany, traveling by German and Japanese submarines and by plane, and
                        arrived in May 1943 in Tokyo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jun 4, 1943</strong> &dash; A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of
                        Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany, traveling by German and Japanese submarines and by plane, and
                        arrived in May 1943 in Tokyo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mar 18, 1944</strong> &dash; His Army Reached Indian Soil &mdash; In a stubborn battle,
                        the mixed Indian and Japanese forces, lacking Japanese air support, were defeated and forced to
                        retreat; the Indian National Army nevertheless for some time succeeded in maintaining its
                        identity as a liberation army, based in Burma and then Indochina.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aug 18, 1945</strong> &dash; A few days after Japan’s announced surrender in August
                        1945, Bose, fleeing Southeast Asia, reportedly died in a Japanese hospital in Taiwan as a result
                        of burn injuries from a plane crash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aug 18, 1945 &dash; present</strong> &dash; Death of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose is
                        mystry for the whole world...after Aug 14, 1945 many people claims that they have seen, have
                        been in touch but it's still mystery for the world...where he have been...whatever happen, but
                        India and Indian will awlawys remember this legend for his contribution in the Indian freedom
                        fight. Jai Hind. </li>
